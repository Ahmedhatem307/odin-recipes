    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Onion soup, a classic French dish known as "soupe à l'oignon," is a comforting and 
        flavorful soup that captures the essence of simple yet hearty cooking. The foundation 
        of this dish is the slow caramelization of onions, which brings out their natural 
        sweetness and rich, savory flavors. Typically, yellow or white onions are thinly 
        sliced and cooked in butter or olive oil over low heat until they become golden 
        brown and fragrant. This process can take up to an hour but is crucial for developing 
        the deep, complex taste that defines a good onion soup. Once the onions are caramelized, 
        they're deglazed with white wine or sherry, and then combined with beef or vegetable broth, 
        a bay leaf, and thyme, simmering until the flavors meld beautifully.

        The soup is traditionally served with a slice of toasted baguette and a generous 
        topping of grated Gruyère cheese, which is melted under the broiler until bubbly 
        and golden. The combination of the sweet, caramelized onions with the robust broth,
         crispy bread, and gooey cheese creates a delightful mix of textures and flavors 
         in every bite. Some variations might include a splash of brandy or the addition of 
         garlic for extra depth. Onion soup is often enjoyed as a starter, but it can also be 
         a satisfying main course when paired with a simple green salad and a glass of wine.
