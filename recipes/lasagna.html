    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Lasagna, a beloved Italian classic, is a hearty and comforting dish 
            that layers pasta, rich meat sauce, creamy béchamel, and melted 
            cheese. The foundation of a traditional lasagna starts with a robust 
            Bolognese sauce made from ground beef, onions, garlic, and tomatoes, 
            simmered together with herbs like oregano and basil. This sauce is 
            layered with lasagna noodles, which can be either boiled beforehand 
            or used as no-boil sheets. Each layer is then generously covered 
            with béchamel sauce—a creamy mixture of butter, flour, and milk—and 
            a blend of cheeses, typically mozzarella and Parmesan, which melt 
            beautifully to create a gooey, golden top. 
        </p>
    
        <p>
            Assembling the lasagna involves spreading a thin layer of meat sauce at 
            the bottom of the baking dish, followed by a layer of noodles, more meat 
            sauce, béchamel, and cheese. This process is repeated until the dish is 
            filled, ending with a final layer of noodles topped with the remaining 
            béchamel and cheese. Baked in the oven until the top is bubbly and 
            golden brown, lasagna is a perfect example of comfort food, offering a 
            delightful mix of flavors and textures in every bite. Whether served for 
            a family dinner or a special occasion, this dish is sure to please and 
            satisfy with its rich, layered goodness.
